    <li>Nobody knows when  or why St Laurence Church  was built. It dates from around AD1000. </li>
    <li>It was never the parish church, which may be buried beneath Holy Trinity church.</li>
    <li>Possibly it was a shrine to King Edward the Martyr, murdered in A.D. 978.</li>
    <li>A 15th century copy of a charter states that Bradford was to be used to shelter Edwardâ€™s relics against Viking raids.  </li>

    <li>The church is a Grade 1 listed building, described as a building of exceptional archaeological value.  </li>
    <li>It is one of only a few complete Saxon churches in Great Britain, and as such is extremely rare. </li>
    <li>Most other Saxon churches have been substantially altered at a later date or survive as portions embedded in later structures.</li>
    <li>The church is managed by <a href="https://saxonchurch.org.uk/">Trustees</a> </li>

<h>A significant event was the drawing of the elevations by W C Lukis in 1858.</h>
<h> Canon Jones who discovered the building commented:</h>
<h> "The design and nature of the building entirely escaped the notice of archaeologists".</h>
<h>These drawings are used here to produce a 3D model, roughly representing how the new discovery was perceived.</h>
<h>   </h>
<p>The church originally had a south porch, and the line of its roof can still be seen on the south elevation. <a href = "https://racgit99.github.io/3dmodels/">Click to view - left button to rotate, centre wheel to zoom></a></p>
